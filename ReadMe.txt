How to play:
 - When you run the code, you will be asked if you want to play multiplayer or against the AI. To play against the AI, press 2 on the keyboard and then Enter.
 - The AI will place its 'X'.
 - When it's your turn: press 1-9 on the keyboard and then Enter to place a piece.
 
How the AI works:
 - The AI places an 'X' in a corner on its first turn.
 - If the player (you) places an 'O' in the center on their first turn, either the AI wins or it's a tie (stalemate).
 - If the player places an 'O' outside of the center on their first turn, the AI will always win (it may result in stalemate).

How to have the best chance against the AI:
 - On your first turn, place 'O' in the center.
 - Then, place 'O' on one of the sides (not in the corner, as the AI will win).
 - Hope for a stalemate.
 
If you win:
 - Congratulations!
 - There is a mistake in the code.
